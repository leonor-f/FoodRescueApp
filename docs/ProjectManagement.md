#### Iteration retrospectives
After a group brainstorm of themes for the project, the ideal, innovative and disruptive emerged: an application that presents food products near expiration date of a supermarket. The next steps were to explore and better define the scope of the project, some features and division of tasks. 
At the end of the iteration, we could successfully accomplish all the pre-defined tasks (product vision, an elevator pitch draft, requirements, and architecture and design). We developed a small part of some functionalities (bottom search bar) and tested the databases, as well as the maps to better manage the technologies necessary for the development of the project in the next iterations and adapt our plan, if necessary. We also achieved the intended design of the app in the prototype.
The team worked well, demonstrating effective communication and collaboration throughout the planning of the project.

</p>

#### Iteration retrospectives
In this iteration, two of the three user stories that were defined were successfully completed (list of user's favorite supermarkets page and shopping list page). In discussion we decided that we would discard the use of Google Sheets API as a database to implement it in SQL instead, in order to facilitate and stabilize data access and manipulation. 
We continued to enhance our features by subdividing them into new ones, adding value while maintaining a strong focus on providing the best user experience.

### Iteration #2

</p>

#### Iteration retrospectives
This iteration was key to the continued growth of the app, as we were able to implement location and pin identification of the user's current location and fully transpose Google Sheets data into a correct SQL database. All the other pre-defined tasks have been successfully accomplished (the removal of supermarkets from the user's favorite list, the removal of products from the user's shopping list and the development of unit and acceptance tests for the already implemented features). At this point, we were able to recognize that the course of the project is in line with that initially stipulated.

### Iteration #3

</p>

#### Iteration retrospectives
Like the previous iteration, this iteration was very evolutionary and allowed us to finalize practically all the features stipulated initially and even add extra features, but which add value to our app, explained below. In order to simplify and clarify the user about the app, we have added a new feature that shows a tutorial on how to use the app when it is opened for the first time. In addition, we fulfill all the tasks stipulated at the beginning of the iteration (see products near expiration dates, add items to the shopping list, search supermarkets). In the next iteration, we will finish all the must-have features of the app (the only one missing is to choose a supermarket) and the last should-have feature (order products).

### Iteration #4

#### Iteration retrospectives
In this iteration, we fixed a duplicate data error when adding a product to the shopping list. In addition, we successfully completed
all the missing features (sort products by price and expiration date, and choose one of the supermarkets pinned on the map). We also
updated the acceptance and unit tests, as well as almost all the documentation (readme, architecture and design, product vision and
project management). Finally, we considered relevant to the project the creation and implementation of a new feature: choose the
supermarket chains and the maximum distance they can have from the user's location. Therefore, we were able to complete and deepen
the app even more, contributing to the user experience.

We couldn't be more pleased with the final outcome of our project. We successfully accomplished all the milestones we set out to achieve. Although the task allocation didn't go as planned, it didn't hinder our team's positive relationship, which ultimately led us to achieve a successful end result.
