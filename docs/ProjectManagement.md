#### Iteration retrospectives
All required tasks have been successfully accomplished (product vision and elevator pitch, requirements,
and architecture and design).
We developed a small part of some functionalities and tested the databases, as well as the maps to better
manage the technologies necessary for the development of the project in the next iterations and adapt our
plan, if necessary. We also achieved the intended design of the app in the prototype.
