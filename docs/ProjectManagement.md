## Project management

### Iteration #0
You can find below information and references related with the project management in our team:
* Backlog management: Product backlog and Iteration backlog in a [Github Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/projects/34)
* Release management:
    * [v0](#)
    * [v1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC09T3/blob/main/docs/ProjectManagement.md#iteration-1)
    * [v2](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC09T3/blob/main/docs/ProjectManagement.md#iteration-2)
    * [v3]

#### Iteration retrospectives
All required tasks have been successfully accomplished (product vision and elevator pitch, requirements,
and architecture and design).
We developed a small part of some functionalities and tested the databases, as well as the maps to better
manage the technologies necessary for the development of the project in the next iterations and adapt our
plan, if necessary. We also achieved the intended design of the app in the prototype.

#### Iteration retrospectives
In this iteration, two of the three user stories that were defined were successfully completed, and one that was not initially planned was deemed valuable and appropriate to complete as well.
We can already see the app taking shape as some features are being added.

### Iteration #2

#### Iteration planning
- Start of iteration:
<p align="center" justify="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC09T3/blob/main/images/start_v2.png"/>

  <img src="https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC09T3/blob/main/images/end_v2.png"/>
</p>

#### Iteration retrospectives
All required tasks have been successfully accomplished (the complete implementation of the SQL database, the location of the user on the map, the removal of supermarkets from the user's favorite list, the removal products from the user's bucket list and the development of unit and acceptance tests for the implemented features).
The next steps are to make small adjustments to some of the user stories, develop the last 2 must-have features and 2 should-have features.

### Iteration #3

#### Iteration planning

</p>

#### Iteration retrospectives
To simplify and clarify the user about the app, we have added a new feature that shows a tutorial on how to use the app when it is opened. In addition, we fulfill all the tasks stipulated at the beginning of the iteration (see products near expiration dates, add items to the bucket list, search supermarkets, see supermarkets in a radius of 5 km and filter products). In the next iteration, we will finish all the must-have features of the app (the only one missing is to choose a supermarket) and the last should-have feature (order products).
